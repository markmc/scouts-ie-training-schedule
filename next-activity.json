We committed at that time to briefing County Commissioners on the final proposals prior to launching them to the membership at large.\n\nNational Council will meet again at the end of June to consider notice of motion to give effect to these proposals.\n\nThe Governance Review Group would like to invite County Commissioners and members of the National Management Committee to a joint briefing to be held on Sunday 20th May 2018 in Willington Scout Den, Templeogue, Dublin 6W.  The meeting will start at 10 a.m. and conclude no later than 1 p.m., a light lunch will be available afterwards.  This meeting is a single item agenda meeting to consider the proposals but is not the summer County Commissioners Conference, as this will now be held at a later date.",

Places can and will be offered to others if payment is not received.\n\nBasic information and programme theme.\n\nThe World is not what it once was. The Dead now walk the land, while the living fight to survive to see the morning sun of tomorrow. The never-ending nightmare began and spread itself everywhere like a virus before civilization could react. The once thriving world full of dreams and prosperity now smells like pungent death. Life for the survivors is constantly being threatened by the dangers that await. In a world where humans are the prey, the survivors must acquire extraordinary skills in order to make it through just one more day.  \nAre you brave or crazy enough to take on a challenge where every decision you make could be the difference between life and the undead? This challenge is not for the faint hearted, you will have to undertake your journey with the minimum of equipment and resources. Teams of Rover Scouts must work together to build shelters, light fires, scavenge resources, fight off the undead and any other obstacles they come across.",

Above all, it tests determination and desire. If you make it to the end, it will probably be the greatest achievement of your life, and with it comes the realization that you can do 20 X more than you ever thought possible. \n\nIt is a defining moment that you will reach back to when in combat. You know that you will never, ever quit, or let a teammate down.\n\nDo you think you're tough enough to complete this challenge?\n\nInquires about the event survivorchallenge@scouts.ie\nInquires about the booking events@scouts.ie",

The organisers will not be making up teams from individuals for the event.\n\nOne accompanying scouter is included in the price for a team so only additional scouters or rovers wishing to staff the event will have to book on and pay. \nFor more information please check Activity Information, any queries about the event please contact venturescouts@scouts.ie\n\nAny booking inquiries contact events@scouts.ie",

    "Description": "Ceiliúradh is the final step in the Rover Service project cycle. It is all about celebrating the work carried out by rover crews within their section, group and wider community. It gives rover crews the chance to share their experience from their service project as well as connect with other crews, all the while inspiring others to take on service projects of their own. This Ceiliúradh will be a special one as there has not been an event such as this for rovers since before the Covid-19 pandemic. Due to this, there have been 4 years of projects that have not been celebrated. To make this a memorable celebration of all the work carried out by rovers our theme is \"A night at the Roscars\"(Rover Oscars). Rovers, their Advisors and Group leaders will be able to nominate individuals and crews to receive a Roscars. This could be for exceptional service within a rover section, a completed rover service project or an award for special recognition.\n\nThe event will take place in a formal setting with attendees encouraged to dress formally. A meal will be served following the awards ceremony. The award ceremony will then take place. Following the awards ceremony there will be a dance. \n\nAny questions on this event please contact roverscouts@scouts.ie\nAny questions about the booking please contact events@scouts.ie\n\nPlease note that all youth members will be expected to complete Safe from Harm training module 1 (SfH 1: Safe from Harm Essential Learnings) and submit proof of completion to the National Rover team. The module may be found at: https://learn.scout.org/resource/sfh-1-safe-harm-essential-learnings.\n\nOnline payments only:",
